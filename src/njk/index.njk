      <p>
         In the context of U.S. Elections, gerrymandering is the process of redrawing election maps in order to benefit one’s particular group (usually the one in power). The two types of gerrymandering are:
      </p>
      <br>
      <div class="row">
        <p class="col-sm-6">
          <strong>Partisan gerrymandering -</strong> This is when the maps are drawn to either favor or disadvantage a <strong>political party</strong>. This is very likely to occur when one party controls the entire redistricting process, and is typically the form of gerrymandering people think of today (and the one we’ll be focusing on). 
        </p>
        <p class="col-sm-6">
          <strong>Racial gerrymandering -</strong> This is when the maps are drawn to either favor or disadvantage a certain race/ethnic group. Unlike partisan gerrymandering, racial gerrymandering has been considered unconstitutional by the Supreme Court (originally ruled in <em>Shaw v. Reno</em> (1993) and affirmed in <em>Miller v. Johnson</em> (1995)).

      <p class="subhead bold_font_2">What is redistricting?</p>
      <p>
        Redistricting is the process of redrawing the geographic district lines used to elect members of the U.S. House of Representatives (and other state lawmakers depending on the state). It is done every 10 years following the U.S. Census.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="why-sect">
      <p class="subhead bold_font_2">Why gerrymandering is done</p>
      <p>
        There are many reasons why politicians would want to gerrymander congressional districts. It makes winning future elections easier, helps prevent the minority party from regaining control, and helps keep the party in power for longer since these maps can last for up to ten years (or five election cycles). There are many consequences to elections and redistricting, and gerrymandering might be the greatest of them all.
      </p>

      <p class="subhead bold_font_2">Why redistricting is done</p>
      <p>
        Redistricting is done every 10 years because of reapportionment following the U.S. Census. Reapportionment is the process of taking the new census data and using it to calculate how many members each state will get in the United States House of Representatives. Once that is calculated, each state will take that data and redraw their congressional maps using a variety of methods.

    <div id="how-sect">
      <p class="subhead bold_font_2">How is gerrymandering done? </p>
      <p>
        There are actually two main ways a party can create a gerrymander. These are commonly known by political scientists as <strong>cracking</strong> and <strong>packing</strong>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <div class="row">
        <p class="col-sm-6">
          <strong>Cracking -</strong> Cracking is the practice of spreading out a certain group of voters along the lines so that their impact is either minimized or outright eliminated. The example of ‘cracking’ in the example above would be the second picture, where there are 5 districts and no red despite red making up 40% of the population. This is because the district lines ‘cracked’ the red population by splitting it up over 5 districts, meaning it is now impossible for red to win any of those districts.
        </p>
        <p class="col-sm-6">
          <strong>Packing -</strong> Packing is the practice of cramming a certain group of voters into one district so that their impact on the electorate is minimized. In the example above, ‘packing’ would be the third map where red wins 3 districts while only making up 40% of the population. This is because Blue voters were crammed (or ‘packed’) into two districts where they make up a great deal of the population, while red skewed it so that they’d have enough to win three of the five districts.

      <p class="subhead bold_font_2">How is redistricting done?</p>
      <p>
        Redistricting is a process that most states will go through (well, as long as they have more than one congressional district). However the way states redistrict their maps can actually vary depending on where you live. Here are generally some of the ways redistricting occurs: 
      </p>
      <br>
      <div class="row">
        <p class="col-sm-6">
          <strong>State Legislatures -</strong> In this scenario, the state legislature has full control over redistricting. It works very similarly to drafting a normal bill, as the legislature will construct maps, possibly hold hearings if required by law, and then vote on it with final approval from the state governor. What makes this method so controversial however is that gerrymandering. Unfortunately for opponents of gerrymandering, this is the method of redistricting in a majority of states.
        </p>
        <p class="col-sm-6">
          <strong>Redistricting Commissions -</strong> In this scenario, an independent commission is appointed (usually of non-elected officials) that will redraw the maps. This commission is meant to be made up equally of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. For opponents of gerrymandering, this is typically seen as a fairer method since it requires input from the minority party. However this method is only used in a handful of states, and some states that do utilize it still allow the state legislature to have the final say.

          <strong>States that use state legislatures for redistricting:</strong> 25, including Texas

          <strong>States that use independent commissions:</strong> Washington, California, Idaho, Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, and New Jersey (politician commission)
