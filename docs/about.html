      What the … is Gerrymandering?!? is a project created by students from the University of Texas at Austin to educate and spread awareness about the importance of redistricting and the consequences of a practice like gerrymandering.

      <strong> Andres “Andy” Cerda</strong> is a fourth-year Journalism and Government student attending his final semester at the University of Texas at Austin. Originally from the Rio Grande Valley, Andy comes from a family of six children and even has a twin brother! When he is not busy with online classes, Andy spends most of his free time researching American Politics and Congressional Elections. Whether it’s in the form of creating custom maps on 270toWin.com or reading about elections from 50 years ago, studying elections has become a big hobby of his. He is also a heavy consumer of political media, with his favorite podcasts being “Pod Save America” and “Pod Save the World.” After graduating from UT, Andy hopes to attend law school and earn his Juris Doctor (JD).

      <strong>Christina Peebles</strong> is a senior journalism student in her final semester at UT. When she isn’t writing stories, she’s either nose deep in programming projects for her Elements of Computing certificate or staying up too late on Adobe InDesign as Design Editor of The Daily Texan. In the rare chance she has free time, you can find her taking care of her plants, rock climbing, starting a new embroidery project, or spending too much time watching her GameStop share go negative on the stock market. In the fall of 2020, Christina decided to teach herself HTML and CSS to fulfill her goal of developing her own portfolio website from scratch. A semester later of throwing drafts away in the bin and starting fresh, she has learned a lot about front-end development and can’t wait to continue pursuing and practicing her new skills with our new project!

      <strong>Gabi Wongso</strong> is a senior journalism and Radio-TV-Film student currently finishing her final semester at UT. She is also currently working as a Communications Intern at Silicon Labs. When she is not working or studying, you will find her in her favorite dog park with her dog, Lady, or cooking at home. Some other times, you would find her binge-watching “Parks and Recreation,” “The Office” or crime documentaries. Throughout her college experience, Gabi was able to gain many experiences in creating marketing and PR, graphic design, website design, and filmmaking. As Spring 2021 becomes her final semester, she hopes to get the most out of the semester, especially with this project, as she hopes to gain more experience in UX/UI design, learn more about project management, and improve her coding skills. After she graduates, she will continue her education at the University of Texas, studying for her Master’s degree in Marketing, where she hopes the program will help her expand her knowledge in marketing analytics and market research.
